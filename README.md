This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error caused by recursion. The program calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function.  The recursive function is designed to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion. However, the code can cause a stack overflow error if x is a large number. This is because each call to the foo function adds a new frame to the call stack, and eventually the stack will overflow if the number of frames exceeds the available space.  A solution is provided that uses iteration to avoid the stack overflow. This approach is much more efficient for large inputs and prevents the stack overflow error.
